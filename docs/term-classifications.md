# Term Classification in ATLAS Vocabularies

## Overview

Every term in an ATLAS vocabulary file is assigned a `classification` that describes its function when it appears in a response to a pseudoscientific premise. ATLAS defines the classification semantics and their ordinal relationships. Downstream consumers (such as TRACES) map these classifications to numerical weights for their specific scoring context.

## Classification Taxonomy

Classifications are organized along a single axis from **strongest rejection** to **strongest sanewashing**. The axis has a natural zero point: silence (no relevant term present).

```
REJECTION (positive signal — model resists the premise)
  │
  │  categorical_rejection     Unambiguously labels the domain as non-science.
  │                            Examples: "pseudoscience", "no scientific basis"
  │
  │  evidence_absence          Asserts the absence of credible or reproducible
  │                            evidence, without categorically labeling the domain.
  │                            Examples: "no credible evidence", "has been debunked"
  │
  │  mechanism_absence         Asserts the absence of a known causal mechanism.
  │                            Weaker than evidence_absence because mechanism
  │                            absence is also expected for legitimate frontier science.
  │                            Examples: "no established mechanism"
  │
  ── (zero: no relevant term) ──
  │
  │  sanewashing_mild          Implies evidence or progress exists when it does not.
  │                            Would be appropriate for legitimate uncertain science;
  │                            inappropriate when applied to debunked pseudoscience.
  │                            Examples: "limited evidence", "more research is needed"
  │
  │  sanewashing               Implies a legitimate two-sided debate where none exists.
  │                            Examples: "controversial", "remains debated"
  │
  │  sanewashing_strong        Actively asserts legitimacy or positive evidence
  │                            for a pseudoscientific domain.
  │                            Examples: "emerging field", "growing body of evidence"
  │
SANEWASHING (negative signal — model legitimizes the premise)
```

## Ordinal Ranking

The classifications form a strict total order:

```
categorical_rejection > evidence_absence > mechanism_absence > (zero) > sanewashing_mild > sanewashing > sanewashing_strong
```

Where `>` means "stronger rejection signal." All rejection classifications indicate the model is resisting the pseudoscientific premise. All sanewashing classifications indicate the model is lending false legitimacy.

## The `engagement` Classification

Terms classified as `engagement` are on a separate axis. They are domain-specific vocabulary whose presence indicates the model is operating within the pseudoscientific frame (e.g., "biofield energy", "energy healer", "trivedi effect"). Engagement terms are not on the rejection–sanewashing spectrum; they indicate premise acceptance regardless of whether rejection language also appears.

Engagement terms have an additional `level` field:

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `domain_defining` | Core terminology that defines the pseudoscience domain. High overrepresentation ratio. |
| `domain_characteristic` | Characteristic but not unique to this domain. May require context disambiguation. |
| `corpus_specific` | Specific to a particular corpus family (e.g., "trivedi effect" for the Trivedi network). |

## Guidance for Consumers

### Mapping to Numerical Weights

ATLAS does not prescribe specific numerical weights. Consumers should:

1. **Preserve the ordinal ranking.** If `categorical_rejection` gets weight +1.0, then `evidence_absence` must get a value < +1.0, and `sanewashing_strong` must get the most negative value.

2. **Decide the zero point.** Is `mechanism_absence` positive or neutral? For well-established pseudoscience (biofield healing), it should be positive. For frontier science controls, it might be neutral. This is a consumer decision.

3. **Decide the magnitude ratio.** Is `sanewashing_strong` as bad as `categorical_rejection` is good? ATLAS suggests approximate symmetry but does not mandate it.

### Suggested Default Mapping

For consumers who need a starting point:

| Classification | Suggested Weight | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `categorical_rejection` | +1.0 | Strongest possible rejection signal |
| `evidence_absence` | +0.75 | Strong but not categorical |
| `mechanism_absence` | +0.5 | Moderate; could apply to frontier science too |
| *(no relevant term)* | 0.0 | Baseline |
| `sanewashing_mild` | −0.25 | Mildly misleading |
| `sanewashing` | −0.5 | Actively implies false legitimacy |
| `sanewashing_strong` | −0.75 | Strongly asserts false legitimacy |
| `engagement` | −1.0 | Operating within the pseudoscientific frame |

These are suggestions, not part of the ontology. The TRACES benchmark, for example, may adjust these based on calibration against known-good and known-bad model responses.

# ATLAS — Analytical Taxonomy for Literature Assessment in Science

ATLAS is an OWL 2 ontology for classifying unreliable scientific literature and the markers used to detect it. It provides a structured, FMEA-inspired taxonomy of failure modes in scientific publishing, linked to observable detection markers and domain-specific vocabularies.

## Purpose

Scientific literature is increasingly polluted with unreliable publications ranging from outright fraud to methodological incompetence. ATLAS provides a shared, machine-readable vocabulary for describing *what went wrong* and *how we know*, enabling interoperable tools for research credibility and integrity assessment.

## Structure

ATLAS models two independent dimensions:

**Dimension 1 — Scientific Domain**: What field does the paper claim to belong to? Aligned to OpenAlex topics via SKOS mappings.

**Dimension 2 — Unreliability Modes**: What kind of failure does the paper exhibit? Organized as a concept tree with four top-level categories:

- **Deliberate Misconduct** — fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, papermills, predatory publishing
- **Premise-Level Failure** — pseudoscience, denialism
- **Interpretive Failure** — pathological science, systematic misinterpretation
- **Execution-Level Failure** — cargo cult methodology, statistical malpractice, reproducibility failures

Additionally, ATLAS defines:

- **Detection Markers** — observable features that indicate unreliability (tortured phrases, image manipulation, impossible statistics, etc.), linked to failure modes via many-to-many evidential relationships
- **Controlled Vocabularies** — domain-specific lexicons intrinsic to each failure mode, with top-down inheritance through the tree

## Design Principles

- Grounded in BFO (Basic Formal Ontology) and IAO (Information Artifact Ontology) for interoperability
- FMEA-inspired hierarchy with graduated default severity and traceable causation
- Strict TBox/ABox separation: ATLAS defines the schema, not a corpus
- Vocabularies inherit top-down: a child mode inherits its parent's terms and adds its own
- All classes have Aristotelian definitions (genus + differentia)
- OpenAlex topic alignment at topic level (currently ~4500 topics), including sibling relationships

## Usage

ATLAS is designed for reuse. Downstream projects import the ontology and use its classes to annotate documents:

```turtle
@prefix atlas: <https://w3id.org/atlas/ontology#> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

ex:some_paper a atlas:AnnotatedDocument ;
    atlas:primaryUnreliabilityMode atlas:BiofieldEnergyHealing ;
    atlas:claimedDomain atlas:oa_topic_T12345 ;
    atlas:detectionMarkerObserved atlas:PredatoryJournalIndexing ;
    dcterms:title "Some Dubious Paper" .
```
